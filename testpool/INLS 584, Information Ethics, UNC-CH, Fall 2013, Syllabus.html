<h2 class="style1"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p class="style1"><b><i>Overview</i></b>. The intention of this course 
is to introduce students to the variety of ethical issues they will need
 to address as information professionals. After a brief overview of 
moral theories and their application to ethical issues, as well as 
ethical codes of conduct for the information professions, the class will
 focus on particular issues that are most salient to information 
professionals, such as information/data as intellectual property, 
software as intellectual property, data integrity/accuracy, software 
accuracy, privacy, access to information/censorship, access to 
information technology, effects of computerization on the work 
environment (job displacement, deskilling, ergonomic issues, electronic 
monitoring), effects of computer-mediated communication on 
understandings of identity and relationships, and effects of 
computerization on democracy and government.</p>

<p class="style1"><i><b>Rationale and relationship to the current curriculum</b></i>.
 Many of the courses in the SILS curriculum briefly address ethical 
issues, such as censorship, intellectual property rights, the effects of
 systems design, and others. By focusing entirely on ethics, this course
 will enable the participants to develop their skills in reasoning about
 such issues.</p>

<h2 class="style1"><a name="text"></a>Textbook and Readings</h2>
<p class="style1">Rachels, J. (2012). <i>The Elements of Moral Philosophy.</i> 7th edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.<br>
  <br>
The text is available at UNC Student Stores. The 7th edition is not very
 different than the 6th edition, so either edition is acceptable for use
 in this class.</p>
<p class="style1">Additional readings will be available as noted in the class schedule. These readings will be selected by 
  the instructor and class participants.</p>

<h2 class="style1"><a name="assignments"></a>Assignments and Evaluation</h2>
<p class="style1">The final grade will be based on one major paper, two 
small assignments, and class participation (including leadership of one 
class session): </p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1">The <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls584_001/584-assign.htm#MajorPaper">major paper</a>
 will be due at the end of the semester (noon, December 10). It may be 
an integrative literature review on a particular ethical issue/case, a 
review of a particular court case or set of cases with implications for 
information ethics, or a critical review of a current book related to 
topics discussed in the course. In each case, there will be intermediate
 deliverables due throughout the semester. (40%)</li>
  <li class="style1">Each student will be asked to <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls584_001/584-assign.htm#develop">develop one scenario</a> describing 
    an ethical dilemma. (10%)</li>
  <li class="style1">Each student will be asked to <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls584_001/584-assign.htm#respond">respond to one scenario</a> describing an ethical dilemma. (10%) </li>
  <li class="style1">Each student will be asked to <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls584_001/584-assign.htm#lead">plan and lead a class session</a>, either individually or with a partner. (25%) </li>
  <li class="style1">Each student will be expected to <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls584_001/584-assign.htm#participation">participate</a> actively throughout the semester, including during the class meetings and in the online discussion forum (15%).</li>
</ul>

<p class="style1"><b><i>Honor Code. </i></b>The Honor Code, which 
prohibits giving or receiving unauthorized aid in the completion of 
assignments, is in effect in this class. Please contact the instructor 
if you have any questions about the application of the Honor Code to 
your work in this class.</p>
<p class="style1"><b><i>Library and Lab Resources. </i></b>You will be using SILS <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/itrc/library/">library</a> and <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/itrc/its/">lab</a>
 resources during the course of the semester. Please remember that many 
of your fellow students also need to use 
  the same equipment and materials. Follow the proper checkout 
procedures and return materials promptly to be a good SILS citizen.</p>
