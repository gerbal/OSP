<p align="left">Welcome to Marketing 
Information 
Services.  This course offers a grounding in strategic and tactical 
marketing for both non-profit and for-profit organizations.  
The focus will be on marketing for archives, special collections and 
cultural heritage institutions (including libraries) on the non-profit
side and on information businesses, entrepreneurial information 
professionals and information service departments within corporations on
 the 
for-profit side.</p><p>

We will take a "big picture" approach to marketing trying to think 
strategically about products and process; places, price and promotion; 
physical evidence and the people involved (the 7 P's).  We will analyze 
cases, listen to and interact with speakers, and explore experiences 
from the real world.  We will think of marketing as a communication 
function equal in importance to other functions (like technical support,
 
public service, research, and human relations. Advocacy for social 
causes, fund-raising and developing ongoing relationships with 
influentials 
will also be addressed.  On the philosophical side, we will consider the
 role of marketing in a democratic society including the dangers of 
too great a faith in the use of markets as a method for allocating 
public goods and services.

<p align="left">In this class you have a choice of textbooks.  Both are 
standard texts and cover similar themes.  We will make good use of both 
texts throughout the class.  The first book is the better choice for 
those considering a career in
public or academic libraries, archives, or other cultural institutions. 
 The second book may be more helpful for those wishing
to pursue a career in a corporate environment (perhaps in a special 
library or IT department) or for those who plan a more 
entrepreneurial career as an independent broker or consultant.  </p><p>

Both books have been ordered and are or will be available in UNC Student

You are encouraged to become familiar with the general marketing 
literature.  A suggested reading list of both LIS and general marketing 
books, 
journals, videos, blogs, and other websites will be provided for you.  
From time to time thorughout the course you will be asked to share your 
suggestions and recommendations for useful additional resources.
</p><p>

Articles on marketing and public relations regularly appear in LIS 
periodicals and websites devoted to type of library or functional area, 
(e.g., <i>Public 
Libraries</i>, <i>References Services Quarterly</i>).  The American Library Association provides an "Advocacy &amp; Legislation" page with many
 links to helpful information items (see <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg">www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg</a>); other professional associations provide similar resources.

</font><blockquote><font color="#990033">
</font><p align="left"><font color="#990033"></font>An underlying assumption of this course is that students 
learn best and 
retain knowledge longer through active participation in the learning process.  
Therefore, classroom sessions will consist of a mixture of short lectures, 
student discussions of material and assignments, case discussions, media 
presentations, active learning exercises, and some lively and inspiring guest speakers.

by
asking and responding to questions and by offering your observations and
ideas.  Participation in class is important and will affect your grade.  
It can be 
accomplished 
in several ways, e.g., providing examples, comments, questions, and 
information during class sessions, providing ">
Class policies that you should be aware of:

</p><p align="left"></p><ul><li>You are accountable for each class 
session's material whether you are in class or not.  Most students find 
it helpful to identify a class buddy at the outset who is will willing 
to collect handouts and share notes in your absence.
<p align="left"></p></li><li>All assignment deadlines are posted in 
advance, usually on the written assignment and on the Schedule page.  In the
event a deadline adjustment is announced during a class session, you are
responsible for knowing about it (See class buddy suggestion above).
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>I encourage you to post your completed 
assignments on a designated space within the Sakai class site so that 
they are available
to other
members of the class for comment.  An open atmosphere in which members of
the class comment in helpful ways on each other's work is encouraged.  
If you do not wish to post your papers to the forum, you may send or 
give them directly to me.

<p align="left"></p></li><li>Assistance to one another is encouraged.  The main 
assignment (either the Market Audit and Recommendations or the Service Learning Collaborative Project) may be done as a team.  
If you work as a team, all members of the team will receive the same grade unless there is compelling 
evidence to the contrary.
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Attendance at every class session is expected.  If you
have an unavoidable absence, please let me know, in advance  
if
possible.
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Asssigned chapters of the text and other assigned activities are to be completed
prior to scheduled sessions.<p>

<p align="left">
Two options exist for the major project in the class.  The first is much
 easier to accomplish when approached by a team of 2-3 people
 but if teaming is not your thing or it's particularly inconvenient at 
the moment, this option may be pursued independently.  The second option
 is individual.
  
</p><ul><li>Option 1 - <b>Market Audit and Recommendations.</b> This 
will create a typical market plan that all organizations are urged to 
develop and keep up to date.  It asks you to select an organization with
 which you're familiar or for 
which information an readily be found and describe and evaluate it in 
market terms and then develop 
recommendations for improvement such as a consultant or new employee 
with marketing responsibilities might make.  The project is organized 
into five parts which are due at various dates throughout the semester. 
 Written and oral reports are required.  
<p></p></li><li>Option 2 - <b>Service Learning Collaborative Project.</b>
 This option allows you to work actively with a sponsoring organization 
on a particular marketing project that can be accomplished in the fall 
semester (at least your part of it).  Examples include designing a 
publicity campaign, planning an event, 
preparing promotional material (e.g., brochure or video), planning and 
publicizing a workshop, re-designing a website or initiating a blog, 
evaluating promotion effectiveness, writing a grant, or the like.  In 
parallel with Option 1, this project also is divided into five parts, 
the second of which is a service learning agreement signed by a 
responsible individual within the selected organization.  A service 
learning contract is required with three interim progress reports 
and a final report and presentation.   
<p></p></li></ul>
Your choice of Option 1 or Option 2 makes up 50% of your grade.  Short 
exercises account for 30% and class participation (in-class 
discussions, ungraded exercises, demonstration of good citizenship in 
the class) make up the final 20% proportion of the grade.<p></p></blockquote>
