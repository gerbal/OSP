<p align="left"><strong>Class Policies and General Instructions </strong></p>

<ol>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">I will always be prepared for class and will start class on 
      time. If unforeseeable circumstances prevent this for any reason, I will 
      try to notify you beforehand if at all possible. I expect the same of my 
      students: be prepared for class, be ready to start class on time, and try 
      to let me know by email if you can't be there.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">My classroom is intended to be a place where you are
 encouraged to share your thoughts, think critically, and feel safe in 
expressing your views. I always welcome your viewpoint, and will be 
respectful of your opinion. Similarly, I ask that you are respectiveful 
of your classmates. </p>
  </li>  <li>
    <p align="left">Class notes and most materials, as well as the class syllabus, 
        policies, and schedule are available on the web (via the top
    of this page). The class notes are available so that you don't have to write down 
        the basic information presented during class, hopefully allowing you to 
    concentrate on the discussions and additional information presented in class. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>You are expected to <strong>bring your laptop to class</strong>. We will work problems during class (SQL, MySQL, XML) 
  that require a computer. We will also search out information during class. I will also ask members of
  the class to share their work (or homework) from their computer on the projection screen.</p></li>
  
  <li>Assignments should be turned in at the start of the class on which 
      they are due.  In general Assignments should be printed out
      and handed in.  In some cases, where the assignment may
      contain large sections of SQL code or XML code I will ask you
      to  email it to me or place at public URL (in addition to
      printout). <strong>In all assignments/exercise, unless
      otherwise indicated, you
      should demonstrate that your SQL code works by showing the
      output from your MySQL run</strong>. All work, printed out, or
      emailed or on web, should be labeled on each page to show your name and
      what assignement/exercise it is, like <i>jones-A3</i>.
      Exercises are also generally due when listed, although
      sometimes I'll tell you that I'll collect them later than
      listed.  Please make sure everything 
      is correct before turning in, so that I receive one and only one correct 
  version of the your homework. </li><p></p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Late assignments. Any assignment received after the start 
      of class when it is due, will be considered late. Late assignments can still 
      be turned in for credit. They are penalized by the following formula: they 
      are docked 5 points for each day they are late (not counting weekends). 
      Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Thus, an assignment due 
      Wed at 11:00am and turned anytime between Wed at 11:01am and Thursday at 
      11:00am would be graded on the usual 100 point scale, and then have 5 points 
      (one day late) deducted from the total.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">You are expected and encouraged to participate in discussions 
      and exercises in class. I will ask students to explain portions of what 
      was to be read in preparation for a class, as well as to come to the board 
      to work exercises. Part of your grade will be determined by the quality 
      of your participation and your willingness to participate. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">Please be sure to subscribe to the class listserv. Click here 
      to join the <a href="http://lists.unc.edu/read/all_forums/subscribe?name=inls623"> 
      INLS 623 Class Listserv</a>. On the form just fill in your email address; 
      leave the other fields set to their defaults, then click Save to add yourself 
      to the list. To send a message to the listserv, you send it to "inls623@listserv.unc.edu", 
      and it will be distributed to everyone in the class. Sign up for the 623 listserv 
      immediately after the first class!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You will  be expected place
      your work in our class work wiki, which is open to the class
     (but no one else). Please try to post your wiki on the wiki 2
      hours before class starts.  This helps me review everyones
      work so I can give you fedback in class.  We will learn MySQL in 
class, but you will be expected to learn a large part of it yourself 
outside of class. There are lots of references on the web. To get 
started read the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/tutorial.html">MySQL tutorial </a>. 
      Please see the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a> section below for pointers 
      to workshops and other materials for learning MySQL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You will be given MySQL accounts on 
pearl.ils.unc.edu. Your account name and login will be db2_X where X is a
 number between 1 and 24. Your number can be found in our <b>Class Work Wiki</b>, under the "Class_MySQL_IDs" page. We will cover how to use it in class, and as well as in our <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls623_001/mysql/mysql-getting-started.htm">MySQL Notes</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Reading assignments should be done <b>before</b> the class for which 
        they are assigned so you can ask questions and participate in discussions. 
        The textbook is not light reading. You may find it easier to skim the reading 
        before class and then read it again in more detail after we have discussed 
      it. If you do this, <strong>do not skip the second reading.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">If there is something you don't understand, please ask about 
      it!<strong> </strong>If you don't want to ask during class, you may ask 
      me during office hours, come see me at some other time, post your question 
      to the listserv, or ask me over email. Your classmates may well be your 
      best resource for MySQL or XML questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">With the exception of group assignments (1 and 7), all assignments  are 
      to be completed individually. You are, however, encouraged to talk to one 
      another about application issues of a general nature (for example, for questions 
      like "How do I do &lt;fill in the blank&gt; in MySQL or XML?").&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">Honor Code: The principles of academic honesty, integrity, 
      and responsible citizenship govern the performance of all academic work 
      and student conduct at the University as they have during the long life 
      of this institution. Your acceptance of enrollment in the University presupposes 
      a commitment to the principles embodied in the Code of Student Conduct and 
      a respect for this most significant Carolina tradition. Your reward is in 
      the practice of these principles. Your participation in this course comes 
      with the expectation that your work will be completed in full observance 
      of the Honor Code. Academic dishonesty in any form is unacceptable, because 
      any breach in academic integrity, however small, strikes destructively at 
      the University's life and work. (From the 8/1/1992 letter to the faculty, 
      signed by Paul Hardin, Chancellor, and John Moody, Student Body President.)</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">Resources: I make every attempt to use high
      quality, current, freely
      available resources for our class.  This allows you to always
      have convenient access to a resource, and saves trees :-).   There may be times that I
      utilize a resource or material from the SILS library or lab 
      during the course of the semester. Please remember that many of your fellow 
      students also need to use the same material. Follow the proper checkout 
      procedures and return materials promptly to be a good SILS citizen. </p>
