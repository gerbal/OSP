<p>COURSE DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>From the SILS Courses webpage: <em>Survey of the history and practice
 of music librarianship, with an emphasis on administration, collection 
development, and public service in academic and large public libraries.</em></p>
<p>Guided by the <em>Core Competencies of Music Librarians,</em>&nbsp;we
 will address key issues in music librarianship, topics including public
 services, collection development, music cataloging, and the use of 
technology in music libraries.&nbsp; Participants will also become 
familiar with some of the basic materials and reference sources 
generally found in music libraries.</p>
<p>COURSE OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use, evaluate and create reference sources in music (Core Competencies 3.1-3.6)</li>
<li>Become familiar with the selection, acquisition and maintenance of 
music materials (Core Competencies 4.1-4.7), with an emphasis on user 
education (Core Competencies 8.1-8.4)</li>
<li>Become familiar with organization and access issues related to music materials (Core Competencies 5.1-5.6; 7.1-7.3)</li>
<li>Learn and analyze the professional ethos of music librarians (Core Competencies 1.1-1.6)</li>
<li>Explore the unique administrative characteristics of music collections (Core Competencies 6.1-6.8)</li>
</ul>
<p>INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS</p>
<p>Reading, Discussion, Labs, Tours, Activities</p>
<p>The course will be organized as a seminar.&nbsp; Readings will be 
assigned on a weekly basis, and presentations and discussions will be 
organized around these readings.&nbsp; Most weeks you will be required

an introduction to a music reference tool.&nbsp;Further instructions are
 below.</p>

<td valign="top" width="97">In-class participation</td>
<td valign="top" width="360">Your participation grade is based on my 
perception of your preparation for and participation in class discussion
 and activities. Class participation consists of doing the following: 
attending class, arriving to class on time, being prepared for class, 
making observations about the readings, asking questions, taking notes, 
actively working on in-class exercises and actively listening. If an 
unexpected problem arises for you during the course of the semester 
(serious illness, etc.), please let me know so that we can discuss an 
appropriate schedule for you. If you need to miss class because of a 
religious holiday, then we can make alternative arrangements for this as
 well.</td>

<td valign="top" width="360">Several times throughout the semester, you 
will prepare synopses of one required reading or tool plus another 
related reading or tool of your choice (from among a list of options). 
You will create a one-page handout to be shared with your classmates. If
 it is for a reference book or tool, follow the relevant guidelines in 
the Sampsel text (use this <a href="https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/427b0d9a-b3bb-42ac-9f2c-9ba3b26de4f2/Assignments/SOURCE%20WORKSHEET.rtf">worksheet</a>
 as a guide); if it is for an article, chapter, study or other 
narrative, give a summary and highlight the salient points of the piece.
 Be prepared to spend 10-15 minutes sharing your reading or tool with 
the class.</td>

<p>Failure to complete any of the work will result in a zero for that assignment.</p>
<p>Final course grade will be assigned according to the following scale:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For undergraduate courses:</span></p>
<p>A&nbsp; = 97-100<br>
A− = 90-96<br>
B+ = 87-89<br>
B&nbsp; = 83-86<br>
B− = 80-82<br>
C&nbsp; = 70-79, with + and − ranges the same as for B<br>
D&nbsp; = 60-69, with + and − ranges the same as for B<br>
F&nbsp; = 59 and below</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For graduate courses:</span></p>
<p>H = A<br>
P = A-, B+, B, B-<br>
L = C+, C, C-<br>
F = D+, D, F</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For participation</span></p>
<p>A = Presence with pizzazz. You attend regularly and frequently have thoughtful things to say.<br>
B = Presence with a pulse. You attend regularly and speak often (and on topic).<br>
C = Presence period. You attend regularly but rarely speak.<br>
D = Dubious participation. You attend sporadically and do not contribute.<br>
F = No participation. You have exceeded the maximum number of allowed 
unexcused absences: 3 consecutive class sessions, or 6 class sessions in
 total throughout the semester (see the <a title="http://www.unc.edu/ugradbulletin/procedures1.html" href="http://www.unc.edu/ugradbulletin/procedures1.html">Class Attendance Policy</a> section of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</p>
<p><b>EXPECTATIONS OF PROFESSIONALISM</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ethics</span></p>
<p>You are expected to abide by the Honor Code of the University, and violations are subject to severe penalties. See <a href="http://honor.unc.edu/">http://honor.unc.edu</a> for details.</p>
<p>Study groups are encouraged, but all formal written assignments must be your individual work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Model these behaviors</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Attendance is expected, but also be intellectually present (not just in body)</li>
<li>Arrive on time for class</li>
<li>Display preparedness for class by completing reading assignments</li>
<li>Respect yourself, classmates and the instructor</li>
<li>Take responsibility for your own learning</li>
<li>Participate! (Involve yourself in the subject in your own way – don’t tune out)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid these disruptive behaviors</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cellphones are disruptive – put them on “silent” while in class</li>
<li>Laptops and smartphones can be disruptive; while in class, use them 
to supplement your learning, not to distract you from learning</li>
<li>Avoid side conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due dates</span></p>
<p>All work is due at class time on the day assigned unless an extension
 is arranged in consultation with the instructor before that date. 
PAPERS AND MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS TURNED IN LATE WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION 
WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE A LOWERED GRADE.</p>
<p>If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to obtain materials 
and information covered during your absence. Exchange contact 
information with a colleague in the course who can provide assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Statement Regarding Disability-Related Accommodations</b></p>
<p>If you feel you may need an accommodation based on the impact of a 
disability, please contact us privately to discuss your specific needs. 
Also, please contact UNC Disability Services at (919) 962-8300 or 
disabilityservices@unc.edu at the Student and Academic Services 
Buildings, located in Suite 2126, 450 Ridge Road, to formally coordinate
 accommodations and services.</p>
<p><b>Diversity Statement</b></p>
<p>In support of the University’s diversity goals and the mission of the
 School of Information and Library Science, SILS embraces diversity as 
an ethical and societal value. We broadly define diversity to include 
race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, 
sexual orientation and physical and learning ability. As an academic 
community committed to preparing our graduates to be leaders in an 
increasingly multicultural and global society we strive to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure inclusive leadership, policies and practices;</li>
<li>Integrate diversity into the curriculum and research;</li>
<li>Foster a mutually respectful intellectual environment in which diverse opinions are valued;</li>
<li>Recruit traditionally underrepresented groups of students, faculty and staff; and</li>
<li>Participate in outreach to underserved groups in the State.</li>
</ul>
<p>The statement represents a commitment of resources to the development
 and maintenance of an academic environment that is open, 
representative, reflective and committed to the concepts of equity and 
fairness.</p>
<p><strong>Communicating with the instructor:</strong></p>
<p>Sending a message via Sakai is preferred; even then do not expect an 
immediate response. I will do my best to get back to you within 48 
hours, but you should plan for longer.</p>
<p>Sometimes the fastest, most effective way to reach me is to simply come by my office, Manning 306.</p>
