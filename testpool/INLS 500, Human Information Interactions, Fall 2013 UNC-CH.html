<h2 class="style1">Course Description</h2>
<p class="style1">This course, INLS 500 - Human Information 
Interactions, is concerned with the behavioral and cognitive activities 
of people who interact with information. The role of information 
mediators - such as other people, books, or computers - is emphasized. 
The course provides an overview of the literature on information needs, 
seeking, and use of information; the role of context in information 
interactions; and how information professionals support information 
interactions.
</p>
<h2 class="style1">Course Objectives</h2>
<ul class="style1">
<li>Be familiar with the empirical and theoretical literature related to
 information seeking, including the recognition of information needs, 
actions taken to resolve those needs, the roles of intermediaries (both 
human and machine), and the retrieval and use of information.</li>
<li>Understand key concepts related to the ways in which information is 
created, structured, disseminated, and used, with particular emphasis on
 scholarly information behaviors.</li>
<li>Be able to investigate the ways in which the context of an 
information interaction can affect the process and outcomes of that 
interaction.</li>
<li>Be able to investigate the impact of technology on human information interactions.</li>
<li>Critically apply theories and empirical findings to the definition 
and solution of problems related to human information interactions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="resources"></a>Resources</font></h2>
<p class="style1">There is one excellent book available for purchase 
from the UNC Student Stores in the Daniels Building (two buildings south
 of Manning). It is not a required textbook, but it is a great general 
introduction to human information behaviors. This book will likely serve
 you well throughout your career, but again - it is not a required text.
</p><ul class="style1">
<li>Case, D. O. (2012). Looking for Information: A Survey of Research on
 Information Seeking, Needs and Behavior (3rd ed.). Emerald Group 
Publishing.</li>
</ul>

In this class, we will be reading many journal articles and book 
chapters. These are available through the UNC Library electronic 
journals, or, in some cases, through Sakai resources. Links to these 
readings are available on the <a href="https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/76c327d2-6546-4df6-99e6-49e8ce29411b">Sakai site</a> under the "Resources" tab.

<p></p>
<h2 class="style1"><a name="assignments"></a>Assignments and Evaluation</h2>
<p class="style1">Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due at noon through the Sakai Dropbox.</p>
<p class="style1">The <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2013_fall/inls500_002/500-assignments">assignments</a>
 for this course aim to develop your understanding of human information 
interactions. Your final grade will be based on four graded homework 
assignments (including one team project) and class participation.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1"><strong>Evidence review memo (35%).</strong>
 Each student will identify, analyze, and synthesize the findings of a 
well-bounded body of literature related to a problem/question in 
information and library science practice. The findings and 
recommendations based on them will be presented in the form of a memo. 
The purpose of this assignment is to assist you in identifying human 
informaton interaction problems, and to develop your critical 
application of theories and empirical findings to those problems. To be 
completed <strong>September 16 - November 13</strong>, with several intermediate deliverables due during that period.</li>
  <li class="style1"><strong>Diary and analysis of an information-seeking event (20%).</strong>
In this assignment, you will keep a diary of a personal 
information-seeking event and analyze that event in terms of the 
concepts and ideas discussed in the course. The purpose of this 
assignment is to interact with and critically analyze a real-world 
information problem. To be completed <strong>September 25 - October 16.</strong></li>
<li class="style1"><strong>In-depth examination of an example of scholarly communication (20%).</strong>
  
 Students will work in small groups (3-4 people) to select a set of 
articles/works from the "additional readings" page of the course website
 or elsewhere. Each team will analyze the structure and content of the 
papers selected, as well as the way they have been used by other 
scholars (i.e., through an analysis of citations from, to and among the 
papers). The purpose of this assignment is to understand how information
 is created, structured, disseminated, and used in scholarly 
communication. To be completed <strong>November 18 - December 14</strong>, with one intermediate deliverable due on <strong>November 25</strong>. All members of the team will received the same grade for the project.</li>
 <li class="style1"><strong>Evidence summary (15%)</strong>
Each student will select an article from the literature and write a 
summary of the evidence it presents, using the style published in <i>Evidence-Based Library &amp; Information Practice</i>.
 The student will also share a brief summary of the article in class and
 on the online discussion forum. The purpose of this assignment is to 
build presentation skills and to engage critically with information 
science research. The due date will vary, based on the topic of the 
article selected. Topics will be selected/scheduled in class on <strong>August 26</strong>.
   </li><li class="style1"><strong>Class participation (10%).</strong>
You are expected to be an active participant in this class by engaging 
with the course material, raising questions, and making positive 
contributions to classroom discussions. In order to fully engage with 
the course topics as a class, you are expected to complete all of the 
reading prior to each class meeting. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">In addition, your written work should be of high quality. Please visit the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/">Writing Center</a>
 on campus (in the Phillips Annex, two buildings East of Peabody) if you
 have any concerns about your writing. They are an extremely valuable 
resource.</p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Honor Code</font></h2>
<p><font class="style1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Honor 
  Code, which prohibits giving or receiving unauthorized aid in the completion 
  of assignments, is in effect in this class. Please familiarize yourself with the UNC-CH <a href="http://instrument.unc.edu/">Instrument of Student Governance</a>. The <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/students/honor-system-module">Honor System Module</a> created by the Office of Student Conduct might be helpful to complete.</font></p>
<p><font class="style1" helvetica,="" sans-serif"="" face="Arial,">In all of your assignments, you must attribute your sources and avoid excessive use of quotes. Be aware of the <a href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/plagiarism/">University of North Carolina policy on plagiarism</a>.
