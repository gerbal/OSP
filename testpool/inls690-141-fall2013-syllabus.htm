<h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Students will learn about hardware, software, principles and methods for capturing and curating digital data that have been stored on removable media (ie: hard drives,   floppy disks, USB memory sticks). This course addresses common storage   devices and interfaces; write-blocking equipment and its role in   acquisition of data; levels of representation; basic filesystem   structures; role and importance of hash values and hex views of   bitstreams; software used to conduct forensics tasks; considerations for incorporating forensics into curation workflows; and legal and ethical issues. Students will   have the opportunity to use a range of state-of-the-art digital   forensics hardware and (commercial and open-source) software and explore   ways that they can be applied by information professionals in a variety   of collecting contexts.</p>

<h3>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h3>

<ul>

<li>Understand the major levels of representation in digital collections</li>
<li>Investigate implications of diferent levels of representation for digital curation activities</li>
<li>Working familiarity with hardware and software for the acquisition of data from storage media</li>
<li>Understand implications of digital foresnics tools and methods for long-term curation of digital data</li>
</ul>

<h3>COURSE EXPECTATIONS</h3>

<ul>

<li>Complete readings BEFORE CLASS each week. Manage your time accordingly.
<ul>
	<li>How to Read a Book - <a href="http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf">http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf</a></li>
</ul>    
<li> Written work should be of high quality. If you have concerns about writing, address them early and often.</li>
<ul>
	<li>UNC Writing Center in Phillips Annex - <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/</a></li>
	<li>Most importantly, your peers.
</ul>	

<li>Come to class on time

<li>Participate in discussions and class exercises - counts as 20% of your total grade for the course</li>

<li>Demonstrate that you have read the material, understood and synthesized it.

<li>Practice "respectful and informed ignorance."  Will Rogers said,   "Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects."  This class will be   most effective if everyone feels comfortable asking questions, so   respect the questions of others. Bring to class your own <strong>informed</strong> questions about the week's materials (i.e. be able to convey how you've   tried to understand the issues and what still remains unclear to you).</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Special Needs</strong>: If you feel that you may need an accommodation for a disability or have any other special need, please make an appointment to discuss this with one or both of the instructors.  We will best be able to address special circumstances if we know about them early in the semester.  Our office hours and contact information are listed at the beginning of this syllabus.

<p><strong>Diversity Statement</strong>

<p>"In support of the University&rsquo;s diversity goals and the mission of the     School of Information and Library Science, SILS embraces diversity as an ethical and societal value. We broadly define diversity to include race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation and physical and learning ability. As an academic community committed to preparing our graduates to be leaders in an increasingly multicultural and global society we strive to:  
<ul>
  <li>Ensure inclusive leadership, policies and practices;</li>
  <li>Integrate diversity into the curriculum and research;</li>
  <li>Foster a mutually respectful intellectual environment in which diverse opinions are valued;</li>
  <li>Recruit traditionally underrepresented groups of students, faculty and staff; and</li>
  <li>Participate in outreach to underserved groups in the State.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The statement represents a commitment of resources to the development and maintenance of an academic environment that is open, representative, reflective and committed to the concepts of equity and fairness."</p>
<p><em>- The faculty of the School of Information and Library Science (<a href="http://sils.unc.edu/about/diversity">http://sils.unc.edu/about/diversity</a>)</em></p>

<h3>IMPORTANT NOTE ON PLAGIARISM</h3>
  
<p>It is very important that you both attribute your sources and avoid excessive use of quotes (see separate handout called &quot;In Your Own Words&quot;). Be aware of the University of North Carolina policy on plagiarism. Your written work must be original. Ask if you have any doubts about what this means.</p>
  
<p>All cases of plagiarism (unattributed quotation or paraphrasing) of anyone else's work, whether from someone else's answers to homework or from published materials, will be officially reported and dealt with according to UNC policies (Instrument of Student Judicial Governance, Section II.B.1. and III.D.2, <a href="http://instrument.unc.edu">http://instrument.unc.edu</a>).</h3>

<h3>EVALUATION</h3>

<ul>
<li>Participation in class discussion and lab exercises: 20%</li>
<li>Pose and answer student questions through Sakai (at least 10 questions and 10 answers): 10%</li>
<li>Individual assignment: 15%</li>
<li>Group assignment: 30%</li>
<li>Final Exam: 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important measures of your performance in this and all other classes at SILS will be your ability to engage in challenging materials with your fellow students; your reputation for insights and professionalism among your peers and with your instructor; your integration of course material with the other things you are learning both inside and outside the classroom; and your ability to apply what you’ve learned in your future career.  However, the conventions of academia dictate that I also assign labels (called grades) to your work on assignments and for the course as a whole.</p>

<p>Based on UNC Registrar Policy for <u><strong>graduate-level</strong></u> courses (<a href="http://regweb.unc.edu/resources/rpm24.php">http://regweb.unc.edu/resources/rpm24.php</a>), both assignment and semester grades will be H, P, L or F. Few students will obtain an &quot;H,&quot; which signifies an exceptionally high level of performance (higher than an &quot;A&quot; in an A-F systems). The following is a more detailed breakdown:*

<table width="100%" border=0>

<tr>
<td valign="top">H</td>
<td>Superior work: complete command of subject, unusual depth, great creativity or originality</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top">P+</td>
<td>Above average performance: solid work somewhat beyond what was required and good command of the material</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top">P</td>
<td>Satisfactory performance that meets course requirements (expected to be the median grade of all students in the course)</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top">P-</td>
<td>Acceptable work in need of improvement</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top">L</td>
<td>Unacceptable graduate performance: substandard in significant ways</td>
</tr>
<td valign="top">F</td>
<td>Performance that is seriously deficient and unworthy of graduate credit</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>*Note: The above breakdown is for individual assignments.  Final grades in the course will not reflect + or - designations (i.e. there will be Ps but no P+s or P-s).</p>

<p>According to UNC Registrar Policy, <u><strong>undergraduate grades</strong></u> are based on the following definitions:

<table width="100%" border=0>

<tr>
<td valign="top">A</td>
<td><p>Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.  The A grade states clearly that the students have shown such outstanding promise in the aspect of the discipline under study that he/she may be strongly encouraged to continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">B</td>
<td><p>Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.  The B grade states that the student has shown solid promise in the aspect of the discipline under study.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">C</td>
<td><p>A totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.  The C grade states that, while not yet showing unusual promise, the student may continue to study in the discipline with reasonable hope of intellectual development.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">D</td>
<td><p>A marginal performance in the required exercises demonstrating a minimal passing level of attainment.  A student has given no evidence of prospective growth in the discipline; an accumulation of D grades should be taken to mean that the student would be well advised not to continue in the academic field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">F</td>
<td><p>For whatever reason, an unacceptable performance.  The F grade indicates that the student's performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.  A grade of F should warrant an advisor's questioning whether the student may suitably register for further study in the discipline before remedial work is undertaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">AB</td>
<td><p>Absent from final examination, but could have passed if exam taken. This is a temporary grade that converts to an F* after the last day of class for the next regular semester unless the student makes up the exam.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">FA</td>
<td><p>Failed and absent from exam. The FA grade is given when the undergraduate student did not attend the exam, and could not pass the course regardless of performance on the exam.  This would be appropriate for a student that never attended the course or has excessive absences in the course, as well as missing the exam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">IN</td>
<td><p>Work incomplete.  This is a temporary grade that converts to F at the end of eight weeks into the next semester unless the student makes up the incomplete work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">W</td>
<td><p>Withdrew passing.  Entered when a student drops after the six-week drop period.</td>
</tr>
